  - The ability to call individual methods throguh building a data flow
  - These methods include things like Test, Train, Our Custom Methods, Evaluate, Export
  - Potentially all Moa methods could be called by using the moa abstract class Abstract Classifier
  - The imported file can be used as the default file for components
