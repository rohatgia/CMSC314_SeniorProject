11/2/2017 Notes
  - The ability to edit/configure "modules" throguh building a data flow this is very similar to rapidminer
  - These modules include things like Test, Train, Our Custom Methods, Evaluate, Export
  - All MOA algorithms could be called by using the moa abstract class Abstract Classifier
  - Can be accessed as a CLI or a GUI
  
  BY THE END OF THIS ITERATION WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOAD A FILE SELECT AN ALGORITHM AND EXECTUE THE ALGORITHM ON A STREAM. AFTERWARDS EVALUATION MEASURES WILL BE DISPLAYED
